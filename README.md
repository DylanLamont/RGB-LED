# RGB-LED
This is my project to program an Arduino circuit that will use different PWM signals at different frequencies to control a RGB LED strip on my Robotics team cart (MRT 253).

I am currently trying to simplyfy the circuit and avoid using a breadboard. I am designing the new circuit and the circuit schematic will be posted in the repository.

The code was written on the Arduino IDE and was loaded onto an Arduino uno.
