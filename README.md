# RGB-LED
This is my project to program an Arduino circuit that will use different PWM signals at different frequencies to control a RGB LED strip on my Robotics team cart (MRT 253).

The circuit schematic will be posted in the repository.

The code was written on the Arduino IDE and was loaded onto an Arduino uno.
